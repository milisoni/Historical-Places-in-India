        <p>India is a land of ancient forts, opulent palaces and majestic structures which are not confined to just a
            particular part of the country. They can be found practically in every nook and corner of this vast land.
            These
            monuments have stood the test of time and depict tales of courage, love, betrayal and strength.</p>
        <br>

        <p>India is one of the few countries with such a rich past. The monuments built by different rulers are
            architectural wonders which can still awe and inspire people.</p>
        <br>

        <p>So whether you are a native or a tourist, try and visit some of these places of historical significance. Many
            of
            them are now UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to their cultural and historical importance and, therefore,
            cannot
            be missed.</p>

            city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh on the banks of the river Yamuna. It took 16 years, from 1632 to 1648, for
            this monument to be built.

            second is a section of two Buddhist caves. Other than this, these caves are also a trekking destination.
